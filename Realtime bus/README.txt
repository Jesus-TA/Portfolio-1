#Realtime bus tracker
This project can be used to locate the bus stops between Harvard and MIT. Its part of my work to show my advances on interactive webpages. 
The actual use of the programm is simple load the code into a browser page and click on the button on the right corner to see the marker move onto each bus stop.
The improvements I made from the original code I was given was change into dark mode and update the colors of the button to make the site more appealing.
The original code and licensing is directly related to MIT.
